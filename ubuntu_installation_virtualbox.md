## How to install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on VirtualBox

### 1. Downloading Ubuntu image

**Open the Ubuntu website.** Go to the official website <https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>. You can download the Ubuntu disk image (also known as an ISO file) here. The recommended version for VE280 SU2019 is **Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS**.

### 2. Install VirtualBox

**Download VirtualBox if you haven't yet done so.** Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/. The tutorial to install VirtualBox for both Windows and Mac is here <https://www.wikihow.com/Install-VirtualBox>



### 3. Create a Virtual Machine

- **Click "New".** Click the blue badge in the upper-left corner of the VirtualBox window, which opens a pop-up menu. 

- **Enter a name for your virtual machine.** Type whatever you want to name your virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu) into the "Name" field.

- **Select Linux as the "Type" value.** Expand the "Type" drop-down menu and select **Linux**.

- **Select Ubuntu as the "Version" value.** Make sure **Ubuntu (64-bit)** is selected in the "Version" drop-down menu. Click **"Next"**.

- **Select an amount of RAM to use.** Drag the slider left or right to decrease or increase the amount of RAM that VirtualBox will have available for your Ubuntu virtual machine.

  - The ideal amount of RAM is automatically selected when you get to this page.
  - Make sure not to increase the RAM into the red region; keep the slider in the green region.

- **Choose the File location and File size**. We will be setting the disk type to VDI and the file size to be 40GB. It depends on the free space on your disk. You may apply the default settings.

- **Click "Open", then "Start", then "Install Ubuntu"**.

- **Check both boxes on the "Preparing to install Ubuntu" page then "Continue".** This will ensure that everything Ubuntu needs to run will be installed.
- **Check the "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" box then "Install Now".** This may sound scary, but don't worryâ€”nothing on your computer will be erased.
- **Click Continue when prompted.** This confirms that you understand the virtual machine's virtual drive will be "erased" (there's nothing on it anyway) and begins the Ubuntu installation process.



### 5. Setting up Ubuntu

- **Select a time zone then "Continue".** Click a section that correlates with your position on the map. You may choose **"Shanghai"**. 
- **Enter your username, computer's name and password**.![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ve280/tutorials/master/images/ee65ee3813430c3038eeb6761e3f5fb9408eab3527ed3eeb20a58931d0f36d1b.png)
- **Wait for Ubuntu to finish installing.** This process may take anywhere from a couple of minutes to half an hour depending on the performance of your computer.
- **Restart the virtual machine and log in**. Remember your password.



### 6. Enjoy your journey on Linux
