### 3. Submit your solution

- Once you've finished the project, please compress your code into a tarball and submit it to JOJ. For Project One, the tarball contains only `p1.cpp`. You can make it with the following command in your terminal: `tar -cvf p1.tar p1.cpp`

- Open the project page again and click Problem #1: "Project One: Integers!". This is the only problem you need to submit for this project.

### 4. View the submission result

- After your submission, the grading results will be automatically shown to you. If your solution is not "Accepted" for any test case, please try to debug and improve your solution, then submit it again. Please notice this is only a pretest with 5 test cases. After the due date of Project One, TAs will run the complete test suite which contains 65 more complicated cases. We strongly encourage you to design your own test suite and take every corner case into consideration. Good Luck!
